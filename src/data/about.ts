  summary: `
I am a Computer Science postgraduate student with a strong foundation in software engineering,
full-stack web development, cloud technologies, cybersecurity, and emerging AI-assisted
development practices. My academic journey and professional internships have allowed me
to work across diverse domains including web applications, enterprise automation, machine
learning, IoT systems, and research-oriented problem solving.

I have hands-on experience developing real-world applications for academic, client, and
organizational use, with exposure to modern frameworks, deployment workflows, and secure
system design. Alongside development, I actively explore research areas such as AI ethics,
blockchain security, and applied machine learning, aiming to bridge theoretical concepts with
practical implementations.
